Installation
------------

1. Using Package Control, install "FileDiffs"

Or:

1. Open the Sublime Text Packages folder
    - OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
    - Windows: %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
    - Linux: ~/.Sublime Text 3/Packages/ or ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages

2. clone this repo
3. Install keymaps for the commands (see Example.sublime-keymap for my preferred keys)

### Sublime Text 2

1. Open the Sublime Text 2 Packages folder
2. clone this repo, but use the `st2` branch

       git clone -b st2 git@github.com:colinta/SublimeFileDiffs

Add External Diff Tool *(optional)*
--------

(IMPORTANT: You might need to make a symlink (e.g. in /usr/local/bin) pointing to the command line tool of your external diff tool)

1. Preferences > Package Settings > FileDiffs > Settings - Default

2. Uncomment one of the examples or write your own command to open external diff tool.

   This command *may* need to be a full path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/ksdiff`), if the command isn't in your `PATH`.


Commands
--------

`file_diff_menu`: Shows a menu to select one of the file_diff commands.  If you use the bindings in Example.sublime-keymap, this is bound to `ctrl+shift+d`.

The rest of the commands do not need to be bound (accessible from the menu):

`file_diff_clipboard`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the clipboard (the clipboard is considered the "new" file unless `reverse` is True)

`file_diff_selections`: Shows the diff of the first and second selected regions.  The file_diff_menu command checks for exactly two regions selected, otherwise it doesn't display this command.

`file_diff_saved`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the saved file.

`file_diff_file`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and a file that is in the current project.

`file_diff_tab`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and an open file (aka a file that has a tab).

`file_diff_previous`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the previous activated file.
